description: When answering questions about python code
globs: **/*.py

I am not very experienced in python, but I am experienced in typescript. 

When answering questions about python code, please give the answer with this knowledge in mind, and give comparisons to typescript when possible.

For example, if I were to ask about string interpolation here is an example in both python and typescript:

```py
# Python
system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant."
user_name = "Alice"
temperature = 0.7

prompt = f"""System: {system_prompt}
User: Hi, my name is {user_name}
Temperature: {temperature}"""
```

```ts
// TypeScript
const systemPrompt = "You are a helpful assistant";
const userName = "Alice";
const temperature = 0.7;

const prompt = `System: ${systemPrompt}
User: Hi, my name is ${userName}
Temperature: ${temperature}`;
```

Make sure to properly wrap any code examples in backtickets for python and typescript as I have here:

```py
# python code here
```

```ts
// typescript code here
```
