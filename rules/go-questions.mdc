I am not very experienced in Go, but I am experienced in TypeScript.
When answering questions about Go code, please give the answer with this knowledge in mind, and give comparisons to TypeScript when possible.
For example, if I were to ask about string interpolation, here is an example in both Go and TypeScript:

```go
// Go
systemPrompt := "You are a helpful assistant."
userName := "Alice"
temperature := 0.7

prompt := fmt.Sprintf("System: %s\nUser: Hi, my name is %s\nTemperature: %v", systemPrompt, userName, temperature)
```

```ts
// TypeScript
const systemPrompt = "You are a helpful assistant";
const userName = "Alice";
const temperature = 0.7;

const prompt = `System: ${systemPrompt}
User: Hi, my name is ${userName}
Temperature: ${temperature}`;
```

Make sure to properly wrap any code examples in backticks for python and typescript as I have here:

```go
// python code here
```

```ts
// typescript code here
```
